# Silicon Labs Community Terms of Use

## Scope
These TERMS OF USE apply to the Silicon Labs Community forums and Silicon Labs GitHub account, including the public organizations SiliconLabsSoftware and SiliconLabsSandbox. Throughout this document, the term “Community” applies to both of these platforms.

## Acceptance of Terms
Use of this Community is subject to the following TERMS OF USE. By viewing, downloading, or using any materials from the [Silicon Labs Community](https://community.silabs.com) you agree to these terms. If you do not agree to these TERMS OF USE, please do not use this Community or download any materials from it. If you violate the TERMS OF USE, we reserve the right to terminate all accounts on the Silicon Labs Community forums or block accounts from the Silicon Labs GitHub organization belonging to you without prior notice. We prefer to advise users of inappropriate behavior; however, flagrant or repeated violations of our TERMS OF USE will result in an immediate ban and removal of inappropriate content. Our failure to enforce this policy, for whatever reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of our right to do so at any time. We reserve the right to modify the TERMS OF USE or the [Community guidelines](https://community.silabs.com/s/help?language=en_US) at any time. Continued use of the site is a reassertion of your agreement to abide by the TERMS OF USE.

## Purpose of Community
- We created the Code of Conduct to provide a basic understanding of what's allowed and not allowed in our forums and within our GitHub organizations. The following are the principal guidelines for the establishment and enforcement of our Community (and forums and groups within):
  - Ensure a friendly atmosphere for our visitors and forum members
  - Ensure the privacy of our members and that of others
  - Comply with all applicable laws
  - Encourage responsible use of our Community and discourage activities that disrupt our Community and reduce the value of our services to our visitors
  - Encourage the freedom of expression and exchange of information in a mature and responsible manner

## Please Participate
We would request that all users be respectful of others at all times. We strongly encourage everyone to be kind to those creating contributions by asking questions, posting answers, or creating pull requests or issues. Many visitors will be new to the topic at hand and may need an extra measure of patience in order for their questions to be fully answered. Let’s all welcome new learners and visitors, and encourage their participation in the Community activities.

## Removal for Inappropriate Behavior
It is extremely important for you to understand that this section of our Code of Conduct is not designed to cover everything. We may take action — issue a warning, ban your account(s) and/or IP addresses, lower your post count, delete/edit your post(s)/thread(s), reject your pull requests, close GitHub issues, etc. — if your conduct on the Silicon Labs Community forums or GitHub organization is counterproductive to the TERMS OF USE, or to the proper functioning of the Community itself. Reasons for the corrective action will be communicated when appropriate. The moderators and administrators of the Silicon Labs Community have broad discretion to delete (Silicon Labs Community forums) or ban (GitHub) the account for any user endeavoring to circumvent the decisions of the moderators and administrators.

## No Profanity
You may not use profanity, sexual innuendo, or other types of offensive remarks. Please know that slang may be considered profane when used in certain contexts. This is also a global community, where slang may not be understood or acceptable outside of specific geographical regions.

## No Hate Speech
You may not use terms or audio/visual materials referring to ethnic/national origin, ideological/religious/political beliefs, gender, or sexual preference in a demeaning context. Please note that words carry different meanings in different cultures and that while a word may be acceptable for use in one part of the world, it may not be in another. In addition, anyone can invent their own derogatory terms, unfortunately. Because of those factors, we will evaluate the context in which the term was used to determine whether a violation has occurred.

## No Pornography or Other Offensive Materials
You may not post or link to pornography or sexually offensive materials. You may not post or link to shock sites, or any such excessively obscene material. Blatant violations of this rule will result in a permanent ban on your account.

## No Threats
No personal threats or personal attacks will be tolerated.

## Fair Statement of Disagreement
It is fair and reasonable to state your disagreement with the facts or conclusions of posts and materials found on the site. We simply ask that you keep your remarks tightly focused on the points of disagreement and that you present your position in a reasoned and constructive way. The community is built on the collective experiences of all those participating. The wisdom of the group at large may provide valuable insights into the issue at hand. Please endeavor to objectively illustrate your position so that others can follow your reasoning and perhaps participate in the conversation themselves.

## No Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Materials
No information subject to an NDA may be posted. We will delete posts found to contain materials in breach of the applicable NDA. We reserve the right to cooperate with the companies in the investigation of any NDA breach. You must have the right to post any materials to this site. If you do not have the right to post the materials, then do not post the materials. Do not post material that belongs to your employer unless you have explicit permission to do so. Posting of materials for which you do not have the rights may result in the termination or ban of your account. Note that by posting to this site, you are agreeing that the material becomes the property of Silicon Labs.

## No Trolling
No trolling or deliberate disruption of the conversation will be tolerated. You may not bait/troll users. Bait/Trolling is defined as posting with a clear intent to provoke anger, incendiary posts, and behavior that results in other users violating the TERMS OF USE. Do not post negative posts and discussions that are repeated over and over with no other purpose than to disrupt conversation. If you feel the need to say something, say it once and move on. Do not disrupt multiple threads in order to get your view out.

## No Posting of Private Information
You may not post the private information of others without their explicit consent. Examples of private information include name, address, IP addresses, and phone numbers. You may not disclose a user's unpublicized email address without the user’s prior explicit consent, either by actual consent or by previously releasing such information. You may not distribute any form of private information, email address, private/email messages, and Instant Messenger messages (“Chatlogs”) with intent to harass or demean, as determined by a moderator, regardless of consent.

## Age Requirements
You may not post any form of personal information if you are 13 years old or younger.

## No Commercial Solicitation
No commercial solicitation will be allowed, other than materials placed by Silicon Labs. You may not harvest email addresses or other personal information from our forums, the Community, or GitHub organization for any purpose. We want to avoid spam generated by promotion teams, public-relations campaigns, or any other traffic-hungry webmasters. So please note that the Community is not the place to advertise your own site or forums or sites with similar content to ours. The Silicon Labs staff will not visit your site and spam it with advertisements, so we expect the same courtesy in return. Any Community user who seems to have created their account solely to promote another site will be permanently banned.

## No Illegal Activity
You may not use the Community for illegal purposes, in support of illegal activities, or encourage conduct that would constitute a criminal offense. Such activities will result in a permanent ban from the Community. We reserve the right to cooperate with legal authorities and/or injured third parties in the investigation of any suspected crime or civil wrongdoing.

## Must Use a Single ID
Users must register under a single ID and associate this ID with an active email account. If a warning sent to the email address on record bounces, your account will be banned. You may not register multiple accounts. We reserve the right to terminate accounts whose associated usernames are in violation of the TERMS OF USE or are otherwise deemed inappropriate and/or potentially offensive. Users may be invited to register under a new name at our discretion. Attempting to impersonate any person, including staff, using forged headers, instant messenger names, similar usernames (i.e. “GiIIB”, “Gi11B”, “Angel GillB”) in an effort to deceive or mislead is prohibited.

## Must Not Subvert or Disrupt the Community
Do not subvert or disrupt the Community. This includes but is not limited to:
- Accessing, or attempting to access, the accounts of other users.
- Exploiting, or attempting to exploit, any bugs, vulnerabilities, or loopholes, whether disclosed or undisclosed.
- Penetrating or attempting to penetrate, security measures of Silicon Labs or its partners' providers including both hardware and software.
- All violations will subject all your Silicon Labs website accounts to immediate termination and blocked from further participation on GitHub, regardless of whether or not the intrusion results in the corruption, loss, or theft of data.

## Do Not Abuse the Recognition Feature
Abuse of the recognition feature is not allowed, including soliciting others for recognition or giving an excessive amount of recognition to a specific user.

## Forum/Discussions Guideline: Search Before Post
Before posting a new question, we strongly encourage new users to first search for information on their inquiry to determine if a relevant thread has already been started, and second, please read the community [Help](https://community.silabs.com/s/help?language=en_US) to understand how best to post new threads.

## Forum/Discussions Guideline: Post in Correct Area
Please make every effort to post new question threads in the correct area within the Community. In some cases, the topic may be complex involving multiple topics. In these situations, please use your judgment to place the question in a single product area with the strongest match to your overall inquiry. For multi-topic questions, please add the appropriate tags to the item before posting it.

## Forum/Discussions Guideline: Use Accurate Titles
Please title new threads carefully with descriptive keywords. The advanced search engine that powers the Community will deliver much more accurate search results if titles are accurate and descriptive.

## Forum/Discussions Guideline: Use Pictures
Please use pictures and screenshots if they will help clarify the topic. But we strongly recommend against using large photos over 1 MB. Please crop the image down to the relevant information.

## Forum/Discussions Guideline: Please use Recognition Feature and Likes
If you like a particular post, please avoid an additional “thank you” reply. Use the “Like” button to indicate your appreciation. You can also thank the person who helped you by navigating to their profile and recognizing their contribution by giving a "Badge". Both of these mechanisms are greatly appreciated by those posting responses, and it helps drive the individual user rating system.
