# OpenSource Guidelines

## Summary

This document describes some considerations regarding OpenSource activities.
Since opensource is about cooperation, there is two different perspectives to cover.

The first one is about *consuming opensource software*
: when external code is integrated to SiliconLabs projects.

The second part is about *producing opensource software*
: when SiliconLabs code is shared to users.

In both cases legal, community and architecture aspects should be carrefuly studied.

## Consuming Opensource Software

### Legal

Please refer to internal OSS policy for approved licenses.

### Community

When integrating an external component, beside the legal duties,
a feedback look is also appreciated:
issues and fixes are welcome to be communicated upstream (at the source).

For security or sustainability purposes,
it is also important to follow activities in the upstream project,
and keep sync with latest stables release or security fixes.

### Architecture

Dependencies should be well tracked (at least location and version should be well identified).
If the upstream code had to be patched (for integration purposes),
it should be very clear tracked.

## Producing OpenSource Software

### Legal

Please refer to internal OSS policy for approved licenses.

Each project should provide a license (this is a legal document describing rights and duties).

### Community

### Architecture
